Hello! This is the first blog post published on aliyil.com (also the first blog post I've ever made). So I wanted to take this opportunity to introduce myself a bit and tell you about why I built this website.

## Who am I?

My full name is Ali Abdullah Yılmaz. I was born in 1995 and I'm from Sakarya. I live in Istanbul. I've been a computer nerd since childhood. I learned to code at the age of 20. I started my professional career and have been developing my skills for 10 years now — and now we're here.

## Why this site?

Simply put, I wanted to announce myself to the whole world. To say "There's this guy named Ali, and he provides services at this quality level." I also wanted to have a blog to share my experiences.

So let me announce it from here: I develop software/web applications for small businesses as needed. I help them catch the AI wave. I'll share a blog post about why this is so important in the future.

You can get an idea of the quality of work I do from this site's design and the "Projects" section. I hope it caught your interest. If you want to bring your idea to life with me, please don't hesitate to [reach out](/#contact)!

See you in the next post!
